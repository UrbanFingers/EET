# Everybody Eats Token (EET) White Paper

## Abstract

The Everybody Eats Token (EET) is a community-driven cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. This white paper outlines the key features, tokenomics, and vision for the EET ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Everybody Eats Token (EET) is created with the mission to foster inclusivity, long-term commitment, and active participation within its community.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Empower the community through decentralized governance.
- Reward long-term holders with progressive incentives.
- Support community initiatives and charitable causes.

## 2. Technology

### 2.1 Blockchain
Solana blockchain is chosen for its scalability, speed, and low transaction costs.

### 2.2 Smart Contracts
Smart contracts power EET's tokenomics, governance, and utility features.

## 3. Tokenomics

### 3.1 Total Token Supply
The total supply of EET tokens is fixed at 1 billion.

### 3.2 Initial Distribution
Allocation of tokens:

- **Developer Allocation: 150 million EET tokens (15%)**
  - Example: The developer receives 150 million tokens, which will be utilized for future development, partnerships, or community incentives. However, the developer is restricted from selling any tokens until after a specific milestone, such as reaching a certain market cap or achieving a set development goal.

- **Community Incentives: 400 million EET tokens (40%)**
  - Example: Tokens allocated for community incentives will be used for various purposes, including airdrops, rewards programs, and community engagement initiatives. For example, a portion of these tokens may be distributed as rewards for participating in community events or completing tasks to incentivize active participation and engagement.

- **Development Fund: 200 million EET tokens (20%)**
  - Example: The development fund will be used to finance ongoing development efforts, including hiring developers, conducting audits, and maintaining the EET ecosystem. For instance, funds may be allocated to cover development costs for building new features, enhancing security, or optimizing performance.

- **Partnerships: 150 million EET tokens (15%)**
  - Example: Tokens reserved for partnerships will be utilized to establish collaborations with other projects, platforms, or organizations. These tokens may be distributed to strategic partners as incentives or rewards for collaboration. For example, tokens could be used to incentivize integration of EET into third-party platforms or to fund joint marketing campaigns with partner projects.

- **Liquidity Pool: 100 million EET tokens (10%)**
  - Example: Tokens allocated for the liquidity pool will be used to provide initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate trading and ensure price stability. For instance, these tokens will be deposited into liquidity pools on DEXs such as Serum or Raydium to enable users to trade EET tokens with other assets seamlessly.

### 3.3 Utility Features
- Buy and Hold Rewards: Progressive rewards for long-term holders.
- Reflection Rewards: Redistribution of transaction fees to existing holders.
- Staking Rewards: Additional rewards for stakers.
- Loyalty Tiers: Exclusive benefits based on token holding duration.

### 3.4 Governance
Community-driven governance allowing holders to vote on key decisions and proposals, such as modifying the token supply and freezing the mint authority before launch, as well as organizing shill events, actual giveaways, and meme events.

### 3.5 Transaction Tax Allocation
A 10% transaction tax is applied to each transaction, which is allocated as follows:

1. **Ecosystem Development Fund:** 30% of the transaction tax
   - Percentage: 3%

2. **Marketing and Promotion:** 20% of the transaction tax
   - Percentage: 2%

3. **Community Initiatives:** 20% of the transaction tax
   - Percentage: 2%

4. **Liquidity Pool:** 20% of the transaction tax
   - Percentage: 2%

5. **Burn Mechanism:** 10% of the transaction tax
   - Percentage: 1%

### 3.6 Liquidity Burn
100% of the liquidity generated from transaction fees will be burnt. Considering the allocation of the transaction tax, the liquidity burn will be as follows:

- Liquidity Pool: 20% of the transaction tax
   - Percentage: 2% of the total transaction tax

This burn mechanism helps reduce the overall supply of EET tokens over time, potentially increasing scarcity and value.

## 4. Community Initiatives

### 4.1 Reward Points Program
EET holders earn reward points for participating in community activities, redeemable for benefits.
